Demo of Circuit Fault Diagnosis
===============================

Fault diagnosis is the combinational problem of quickly localizing failures as soon as they are detected in systems.
Circuit fault diagnosis is the problem of identifying a minimum-sized set of components that, if faulty, explains an
observation of incorrect outputs given a set of inputs.

This code demonstrates the use of the D-Wave system to solve such a problem in the case of a three-bit multiplier
circuit. The user is prompted to enter three integers: A and B, which are the inputs the circuit is expected to
multiply, and the circuit's output, P, which represents either a valid or incorrect product of the inputs.

.. code-block::

  Input multiplier     ( 0 <= A <=  7):
  Input multiplicand   ( 0 <= B <=  7):
  Input product        ( 0 <= P <= 63):

The algorithm returns the minimum fault diagnosis (the smallest number of faulty components it found to cause the given
inputs and product) and the number of distinct fault states with this many faults it observed.

Running the Demo
----------------

You can run the demo on classical hardware (a CPU) or on a D-Wave QPU, with the selection made by the pip requirements
file used.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt      # to run on CPU
  pip install -r requirements_qpu.txt  # to run on QPU
  
The demo code has a dependency on `penaltymodel_maxgap`_, which requires that an SMT solver is installed. The solvers
are accessed through the pysmt_ package. See the accompanying *pysmt* documentation for installing smt solvers.

Running on a CPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The demo constructs a binary quadratic model and uses `qbsolv's`_ tabu search to solve the problem classically.

First, install the required files:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Use :code:`pysmt-install` as outlined in the `pysmt installation instructions`_ to setup an smt solver.

.. code-block:: bash

  python demo.py

Running on a QPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The demo constructs a binary quadratic model and minor-embeds it on the D-Wave system.

Access to a D-Wave system must be configured. This requires setting up a `.dwrc`_ configuration file as
described in the `dwave_micro_client`_ documentation. A default solver is required. For example:

.. code-block::

  connection-one|https://one.com,token-one,,solver-one

First, install the required files:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements_qpu.txt

Use :code:`pysmt-install` as outlined in the `pysmt installation instructions`_ to setup an smt solver.

.. code-block:: bash

  python demo.py

Advanced Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`--verbose` option displays the valid/fault status of each component for each minimum fault diagnosis.

.. code-block:: bash

  python demo.py --verbose

Interesting Use Cases
---------------------

A single faulty component leads to five incorrect bits in the product's six bits (due to the commutative property of
multiplication, these are two isomorphic sets) in these four cases:

.. code-block::

  A = 6; B = 5; P = 32
  A = 5; B = 6; P = 32
  A = 7; B = 4; P = 34
  A = 4; B = 7; P = 34

Two faulty components lead to all the product's six bits being incorrect (this is due to the least significant bit being
determined solely by one AND gate) in these four cases:

.. code-block::

  A = 6; B = 5; P = 33
  A = 5; B = 6; P = 33
  A = 7; B = 4; P = 35
  A = 4; B = 7; P = 35

Four faulty components, which is the maximum number of faulty components for a minimum fault diagnosis for this circuit,
lead to five incorrect bits in the product's six bits in this case (one of many such cases):

.. code-block::

  A = 7; B = 6; P = 1

In general, the number of incorrect bits in the product is greater than or equal to the number of faulty components.
